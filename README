Introduction
------------

Cim is a compiler for the programming language Simula (except
unspecified parameters to formal or virtual procedures (see the
documentation for how portable code for formal procedures can be
written)).  It offers a class concept, separate compilation with full
type checking, interface to external C routines, an application
package for process simulation and a coroutine concept.

Cim is a Simula compiler whose portability is based on the C
programming language.  The compiler and the run-time system is written
in C, and the compiler produces C code, that is passed to a C compiler
for further processing towards machine code.

Compilation
-----------

The following instructions assumes that you are using a
Bourne-compatible shell. Further details can be found in the enclosed
INSTALL file.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and 
     type `./configure' (or `CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s ./configure', 
     which is recomended when using GCC) to configure the package
     for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package

  3. Type `make install' to install the package

You may want to compile the run-time-system with CFLAGS=-O2, but
have the cim compiler compile produced C-code with CFLAGS=-O0. 
This can most easilly be done by the following steps:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and 
     type `CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure'

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the package.

  4. type `CFLAGS=-O0 ./configure'

  5. type `cd src; make' followed by `make install'
     
GCC may run out of virtual memory, and therefore you may want to use a
standard C-compiler instead. You can do that by typing `CC=cc
./configure'

Bugs
----

Please mail bug reports for Cim to cim-bug@ifi.uio.no. Please include
the Cim version number and the system type, which you can get by
running "cim --version", a copy of config.cache, and relevant Simula-
and produced C-code.
