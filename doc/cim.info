Introduction
************

   Cim is a compiler for the programming language Simula (except
unspecified parameters to formal or virtual procedures (see item
%nocomment in *Note Implementation dependent characteristics: Dependent
characteristics, for how portable code for formal procedures can be
written)).  It offers a class concept, separate compilation with full
type checking, interface to external C routines, an application package
for process simulation and a coroutine concept.

   Cim is a Simula compiler whose portability is based on the C
programming language.  The compiler and the run-time system is written
in C, and the compiler produces C code, that is passed to a C compiler
for further processing towards machine code.

A simple example
****************

   We show in this chapter a simple example of a SIMULA program and how
to compile and run it.

   Create a SIMULA program with a text editor, and give it a name with
extension `sim'.  In this example we name it `doesit.sim':

     begin
         Outtext("Simula does it in C");
         Outimage;
     end

   You can now compile the program with the cim command:

     %cim doesit
     Compiling: doesit.sim
     cc -w -c doesit.c
     cc -o doesit doesit.o /usr/local/lib/libcim.a -lm
     %

   The compiler will produce C code that is further processed towards
machine code with a standard C compiler.  All produced files have the
same name as the input file, but with different extensions.  The
compiled and linked program can be invoked by entering:

     %./doesit
     Simula does it in C
     %

Compiling
*********

   Cim is a Simula compiler that first compiles the source code into C.
The C code will then be compiled with cc, and linked with other modules.

   The Cim command will accept one Simula program and other non-Simula
modules.  The specified Simula program will be compiled and linked with
the modules.  If a main Simula program is compiled, it will automatic
be linked with the necessary Simula modules.  If a separate Class or
Procedure is compiled, then the linking will be suppressed.

   The diagnostics produced by the Simula compiler are intended to be
self-explanatory.

* Menu:

* Options::                     Options that are accepted by the cim command.
* Arguments::                   Arguments that are accepted by cim.

File: cim.info,  Node: Options,  Next: Arguments,  Up: Compiling

Options
=======

   The following options are accepted by the cim command:

`-a'
`--atr'
     Try to produce an `atr'-file even if an error occurs.  Compare the
     produced atr-file with the atr-file produced from previous
     compilation and if they differ return an error status code.  With
     use of this option it is possible to have external modules with
     circular dependencies.  You will then need to compile all the
     modules with this option until no error status codes are returned.
     Then you should do a final compilation with option `-p' or option
     `-d'.  To get this to work it is important that the topmost
     external head does not contain any external declaration that is
     part of the circular dependency.  Such external declarations must
     be placed in an external head that comes after the first class- or
     procedure decraration.

`-bFLAGS'
`--cflags=FLAGS'
     The ARGUMENT will be passed to the C compiler.

`-BFLAGS'
`--ldflags=FLAGS'
     The ARGUMENT will be passed to the link-command.

`-c'
`--suppress-linking'
     Suppress linking of the complete program.

`-CNAME'
`--c-compiler=NAME'
     Set the NAME of the C compiler.

`-d'
`--compare'
     Compare the produced c code with the code produced from previous
     compilation and if they are equal then touch the object-file
     instead of compiling the c code.

`-DNAME'
`--define=NAME'
     Define a symbol NAME.

`-e'
`--static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this  prevents linking
     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
     effect.

`-E'
`--preprocess'
     Run only the preprocessor and output the result to standard output.

`-g'
`--debug'
     Make the C compiler produce debugging information.  This option is
     useful for debugging the generated code.

`-G'
`--gcc'
     Invoke the Gnu Project C compiler instead of the standard C
     compiler.  This option is useful if the standard C compiler don't
     generate correct code.

`-IDIR'
`--includedir=DIR'
     Use the Simula include file located in directory DIR instead of
     the standard directory.  This information may also be given by
     setting the environment variable `CIMINCLUDEDIR'.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `cim', and exit.

`-H'
`--no-lines'
     Omit line number information in the compiled program.  This  will
     make the program smaller and faster.

`-lLIBRARY'
`--library=LIBRARY'
     Search for `.atr'-files and link with object library LIBRARY.
     This option is passed to the link-command.

     If a `.atr'-file can not be found as an ordinary file, then the
     specified libraries are searched and if the file is still not
     found then the standard cim library is searched.

     This option may also be used for searching Simula include files.

`-LDIR'
`--library-dir=DIR'
     Add  directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for
     -l.  This option is passed to the link-command.

     The standard system directory is searched first and then the
     specified directories are searched.  The standard system directory
     may be given by setting the environment variable `CIMLIBDIR'.

`-m'
`--memory-pool-size'
     The memory pool size may be set at runtime by an option `-mN'.

`-mN'
`--memory-pool-size=N'
     Set the initial memory pool size to N mega bytes.

`-MN'
`--max-memory-pool-size=N'
     Set the maximal memory pool size to N mega bytes.

`-NFILE'
`--input=FILE'
     Set the name of the Simula source file.  This option allows a
     Simula source file to have a name with an illegal extension or no
     extension at all.

`-oFILE'
`--output=FILE'
     The argument FILE is the name of the output executable file.

`-O'
`-ON'
`--optimize'
`--optimize=N'
     Optimize. This option is simply passed to the C compiler.

`-p'
`--pic'
     If supported for the target machines, generate position-independent
     code,  suitable for use in a shared library.

`-P'
`--only-link'
     Only link the specified files.

`-q'
`--quiet'
`--silent'
     Run the compiler in quiet mode.

`-R'
`--preserve-timestamp'
     Recompile the module using the same timestamp.

`-s'
`--no-simula-compile'
     Only C compile and link the specified files.

`-S'
`--only-simula-compile'
     Compile into C code but do not start the C compiler.

`-t'
`--dont-remove-temporaries'
     Do not remove temporary files.  If a main program is compiled with
     option -r, then the executable file will be removed unless this
     option or option -T is specified.

`-UNAME'
`--undefine=NAME'
     Remove any initial definition of the symbol NAME (Inverse of the
     `-D' option).

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Run the compiler in verbose mode.

`-V'

`--version'
     Print the version number of Cim and exit.

`-w'
`--no-warn'
     Do not print warnings.

Arguments
=========

   The following arguments are accepted by the Cim command:

`FILE.a'
     Library of object files and attribute files.  Include this simula
     library when compiling and linking.  The simula library is created
     with ar(1V) and ranlib(1).

`FILE.o'
     Object file of other non-Simula modules.

`FILE'

`FILE.sim'
     Simula source file.  A file name without an extension is assumed
     to be shorthand notation for the corresponding Simula file.

Files
=====

   The following files are related to a Cim compilation:

`file'
     Executable file.

`file.a'
     Library of source files, attribute files and object files.  Include
     this simula library when compiling and linking.  The simula library
     is created with ar(1V) and ranlib(1).  All source and .atr files
     should be placed before .o files in the archive.

`file.o'
     Object file.

`file.c'
     Simula-compiler output file.

`file.h'
     Output file that is included in file.c.

`file.sim'

`file'
     File names without an extension are assumed to be shorthand
     notation for the corresponding `.sim'-file.

`/usr/local/lib/libcim.a'
     Simula library that contains the environment, Run Time System and
     class Simset and Simulation. The source code to Simset and
     Simulation is also included, so these parts can be compiled using
     compiler directive `%include'.

`/usr/local/include/cim.h'
     Include file for the produced C code.

Language restrictions
=====================

   A formal or virtual procedure must be specified with respect to its
type, and type, kind and transmission mode of its parameters (see item
%nocomment in *Note Implementation dependent characteristics: Dependent
characteristics, for how portable code for formal procedures can be
written).


File: cim.info,  Node: Allowed restrictions,  Next: Dependent characteristics,  Prev: Restrictions,  Up: Implementation Aspects

Allowed implementation restrictions
===================================

   * The type short integer and long real is implemented as integer and
     real.

   * The standard access mode SHARED for files is not implemented.

   * The only and default byte size of access mode BYTESIZE is 8.


File: cim.info,  Node: Dependent characteristics,  Next: Defined characteristics,  Prev: Allowed restrictions,  Up: Implementation Aspects

Implementation dependent characteristics
========================================

   * Trailing blanks of image are not transferred to the external file
     on `outfile.outimage' excepts it's a direct file.

   * A parameter to `printfile.spacing' with value zero gives the
     standard effect of overprint.

   * The procedures lock and unlock are not implemented.

   * All open external files are closed when a program is terminated.

   * If the first character of a line is `%' (or `#' as an synonym) the
     line as a whole is a directive line.  The following directive
     lines are supported:

    `%WHITESPACE ...'
          A directive line with a whitespace is treated as a comment
          line.

    `%nocomment ...'
          The rest of the line is treated as ordinary source text.
          Some other simula implementations will ignore this line, and
          give a warning message.  But this can be useful as the
          following example shows.  In this implementation formal
          procedures must be specified, but that should not be done in
          Standard Simula (`Standard Simula, SS 636114.  The Simula
          Standards Group, August 1986').  This will work both on LSH
          (`Simula implementation from Lund Software House AB, Sweden')
          and Cim:

               PROCEDURE P(i1,P2);INTEGER i1;
               %nocomment PROCEDURE P2 IS
                             INTEGER PROCEDURE P2
               %nocomment      (i,j);INTEGER i,j;
                          ;

    `%comment'
          Will cause the compiler to strip all lines until the
          corresponding %endcomment is reached.  This directive may be
          nested.

    `%eof'
          Will cause the compiler to react as if the end of the source
          file was reached.  Include files that are placed in a archive
          must be preceded with this directive line.

    `%casesensitive ON/OFF'
          The case sensitivity of identifiers and keywords is turned on
          or off.  Default value is off.

    `%define NAME'
          Define a name.  Names such as acorn, aix, alpha, amiga,
          amigados, apollo, arm, atari, aux, bosx, bsd, bull, c1, c2,
          convex, cray, cray2, dec, dg, dgux, dynix, encore, freebsd,
          hitachi, hiuxwe, hp, hppa, hppa1.0, hppa1.1, hppa2.0, hpux,
          i386, i486, ibm, integer_64, integer_simulation, irix, linux,
          lynx, lynxos, m68000, m68k, m88k, mach, minix, mips,
          motorola, mpw, msdos, ncr, netbsd, newsosnext, next,
          nextstep, no_real, ns32k, osf, ptx, pyr, riscix, riscos,
          rs6000, sequent, sgi, sni, solaris, sony, sparc, sunos, svr4,
          sysv, tektronix, ultrix, unicos, univel, unix, vax, vms, xmp
          and ymp are predefined dependent of the system.  Operating
          system names may also be succeeded by a version number.

    `%error ...'
          Will cause the compiler to believe that it has found an error
          in the source text.  The message that is preceded on the line
          is printed as an error message.

    `%ifdef NAME'
          If NAME is not defined then the compiler will strip all lines
          until the corresponding `%else' or `%endif' is reached.  If
          NAME is not defined then the compiler will strip all lines
          between the optional `%else' and `%endif'.

    `%include FILENAME'
          Will cause the compiler to include the indicated file in
          place of the include directive line.  This directive may be
          nested, but only to a level of 10.

    `%line LINENUMBER'
    `%line LINENUMBER FILENAME'
          Will cause the compiler to believe that the line number of
          the next source line is LINENUMBER and optionally the current
          input file name is FILENAME.

    `%listWHITESPACE ...'
          A directive line starting with `list' followed by a whitespace
          is treated as a comment line.

    `%nameasvar ON/OFF'
          If it is turned on, then transmission mode for name is
          implemented as reference.  This will produce more efficient
          code.  Default value is off.

    `%pageWHITESPACE ...'
          A directive line starting with `%page' followed by a
          whitespace is treated as a comment line.

    `%staticblock ON/OFF'
          If it is turned on, then data objects will be allocated
          static instead of dynamic, and the compiler may generate more
          efficient code.  This option should be used with care and
          should not be used for blocks which may have more than one
          active data object at a given time.  The option may not be
          used for classes that are given as prefix or virtual
          procedures or procedures that are parameter to other
          procedures.  It may not be used for external classes or
          procedures.

    `%stripsideeffects ON/OFF'
          If it is turned on, then the compiler can generate more
          efficient code, but not necessary correct code due to
          evaluation order for expressions.  Default value is off.

    `%titleWHITESPACE ...'
          A directive line starting with `title' followed by a
          whitespace is treated as a comment line.

    `%undefine NAME'
          Undefine a name.  If the name is not defined the directive
          line has no effect.

   * C is the only language supported for non-Simula external
     procedures.  KIND is interpreted as `C', and the EXTERNAL-ITEM is
     case sensitive.  External C procedures must be specified in the
     following way:

     `External C procedure EXTERNAL-ITEM is TYPE procedure
     PROCEDURE-IDENTIFIER PARAMETER/MODE/SPECIFICATION-PART; ;'

     The rules for external C procedures are:

        - Avoid global symbols prefixed with `__', it may lead to
          conflicts with system names in Cim.

        - The procedure may have any type, except REF.  If the type is
          TEXT, then the null terminated string returned from C is
          converted to a Simula text object.

        - Parameters may not be a Simula-procedure, switch or label.

        - Parameters transmitted by value are always copied.  Texts or
          arrays are allocated by malloc, and are not deallocated by
          Cim.  It's the C-programs responsibility to dealloc the space.

        - Parameters transmitted by reference or name are transmitted
          to C as pointer to.  Texts or arrays are transmitted to C by
          the location of the first element.

        - External C procedures with variable number of parameters can
          be specified by use of `...'  in the end of the parameter
          list.  Printf and scanf can be specified as follows:

               EXTERNAL C PROCEDURE printf IS
                  INTEGER PROCEDURE printf(t,...);TEXT t;;
               EXTERNAL C PROCEDURE scanf IS
                  INTEGER PROCEDURE scanf(t,...);NAME ...;TEXT t;;

Implementation defined characteristics
======================================

   * The internal character set is the same as the standard character
     set.

   * Inlength and outlength are equal to 80.

   * SYSIN, SYSOUT and SYSERR are connected to standard input, standard
     output and standard error.  If they are closed and reopened they
     are connected to `/dev/tty' under UNIX, AIX, LINUX and MINIX.

   * The relative value ranges of real are as double in C and ranges of
     integer are as long.

   * Conversion from an integer type to a real type is exact except for
     implementations where integer have better precision than real
     (which are the case for the alpha and cray implementation).

   * The effect is not defined if the range of a numeric item in a
     de-editing procedure exceeds the value range of the procedure
     result.

   * The exponent from `putreal' has 5 characters except for the cray
     implementation where it may be 6 characters.

   * A text frame has a maximum length of about 64K characters.

   * The return values of `char' and `rank' are as given by the standard
     character set.

   * The exact definitions of the standard mathematical functions are
     system specific.

   * The association between a file object and an external file is
     standard procedures based on C's FILE.  The object is connected to
     the external file when open is called.

   * Several file objects may represent the same external file, but the
     effect is not defined if some of them are opened for writing.

   * A minimum of checks are performed at `locate'.

   * The default value to LINES_PER_PAGE is MAXINT.

   * The `basic random drawing' procedures are implemented as suggested
     in the standard.

   * Two decimals are used for the field for seconds of the function
     `datetime'.

   * Evaluation of arithmetic expressions are based on C, but a Simula
     expression is by default divided up in several expressions, to
     guarantee correct evaluation order.

Capacity limitations
====================

   * The logical limitations of the compiler is documented in the
     header file limit.h.

   * Some other limitations that are based on the underlying hardware,
     the operating system or the C Compiler, which are not checked by
     the compiler.


File: cim.info,  Node: Extension,  Prev: Limitations,  Up: Implementation Aspects

Extension to the environment
============================

   The following procedures are added to the Simula environment and may
be called directly from Simula:

`PROCEDURE Gbc;...;'
     The garbage collector is called when the dynamic storage exceeds
     an implementation dependent limit.  The garbage collector traverse
     and moves all the accessible objects, and leaves the free space as
     one area initialized to zero.  The garbage collector may be called
     explicitly through the procedure Gbc.

`INTEGER PROCEDURE Argc;...;'
     Returns the number of command-line arguments that the program was
     invoked with.

`INTEGER PROCEDURE Argv;...;'
     Returns a pointer to an array of character strings (in C fashion)
     that contains the arguments.

`PROCEDURE Dump(t);TEXT t;...;'
     Dump the state of the Simula-program to file.  Before a call on
     Dump all files except SYSIN, SYSOUT and SYSERR should be closed.

`PROCEDURE UnDump(t);TEXT t;...;'
     Read a previously stored state from file and start the program in
     that state.  To get these procedures to work, they should be
     compiled into the same program.  The program may not be re-compiled
     between a call on Dump and UnDump.

`REF(PrintFile) PROCEDURE SysErr;...;'
     Returns the file object associated with standard error.
